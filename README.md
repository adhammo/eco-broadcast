## Eco-Telemetry description

An arduino collects and sends sensors data through serial to [Eco-Broadcast](https://github.com/adhammo/eco-broadcast) which in turn sends it through an MQTT Broker ([Maqiatto.com](https://www.maqiatto.com/)) to [Eco-Monitor](https://github.com/adhammo/eco-monitor) which saves it to a real-time database ([Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)) which updates, on change, [Eco-Display](https://github.com/adhammo/eco-display) where the data can be seen in real-time.
